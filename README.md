# heroku-nanoc-docs-compiler

This buildpack was created for use with [heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi) when you have a nanoc site that needs to be hosted, but would prefer to handle the asset serving (say in rails), instead of [using apache](https://github.com/bobthecow/heroku-buildpack-nanoc).

Instead of using this code yourself, you should probably use this as a starting place.
